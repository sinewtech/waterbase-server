# :droplet: Waterbase server
Free, open source and self-hosted firebase server. 

## Why
We wanted to have the challenge of something really big...
Plus this a free and open source version of Firebase that we can use on our inhouse projects

## How
Waterbase server is done with a Mongodb server and simple express server  with custom middlewares and some base models for files, users and tokens, all of it would be ready to deploy with a docker image, once alpha is done.
